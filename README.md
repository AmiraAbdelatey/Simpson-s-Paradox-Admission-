# Simpson's Paradox Admission
A few years back, the University of California, Berkeley did a study to determine if their admission process was gender-biased. The study looked at a number of admissions statistics to understand if the university's admissions policies were tipped in favor of one gender over another.

Through this notebook, will illustrate Simpson's Paradox.  

## what we will do through the notebook

Use the Jupyter notebook to analyze "admission_data.csv" to find the following values:    
- Proportion and admission rate for each gender  
- Proportion and admission rate for physics majors of each gender  
- Proportion and admission rate for chemistry majors of each gender  
- Admission rate for each major
